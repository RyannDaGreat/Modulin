Outputs: To Wave File, To Speakers
Idea: Two sawtooths that, with phase shifting per harmonic, cause a formant when played together. These two waves are shifted in opposite directions per speaker half-way, so on their own they both sound identical. BUt if you're in the right part of the room/or the speakers are right next to each other, you might hear "HEY HELP ME IM A SPEAKER!!" or something like that
