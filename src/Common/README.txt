Notes about my code:
The Synth Module has many modules, with public doubles or objects in them without set/get methods. This is because it's verbose, and anything that is not intended to be get or set will be either final (read-only) or private. In other words, any public variables are meant to be set/get at will.
ↈ≣"number of"
Δ≣"change in/of"

Idea: Two sawtooths that, with phase shifting per harmonic, cause a formant when played together. These two waves are shifted in opposite directions per speaker half-way, so on their own they both sound identical. BUt if you're in the right part of the room/or the speakers are right next to each other, you might hear "HEY HELP ME IM A SPEAKER!!" or something like that
